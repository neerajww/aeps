# Capturing and Pre-processing EEG signals
I have analyzed speech and audio signals in my research. They are interesting as - you can quickly record them with a mic, transport to a computer, start processing using different coding languages, and play them back to understand how the mathematical operations altered the physical perception of the original signal. Further, these things apart, speech and audio signals have a time-varying spectrum, and it is amazing how the human brain detects, perceives and responds to this spectrum - like, in a converstation, and enjoying music. Analyzing time-varying spectrum is mathematically active area of research and has engineering applications waiting to be solved, and somehow our brain seems to be good at this problem. How brain does this is a mystery and electro-enchephalo-graphy (EEG) is ones means to analyze this.
