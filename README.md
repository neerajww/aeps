# Auditory Evoked Potentials (AEPs)
This is a write-up to contain and share my understanding of auditory evoked potentials and its application gain understanding of speech perception and cognition.

The human brain is a fascinating signal processing system. Signals are relayed into brain regions from various sensory organs, like the eyes, ear, skin, nose etc., and brain has to respond - often, in fractions of a second. It is true that every organ in human body is incredible in its built and operation, and you may ask what's so special about the brain that it has captured the imaginatiton of a large number of 21st century researchers? Well, most of the sensory organs have been anatomically well understood since 18th century and we have been able to argue about the how of their working as peripheral signal processing units. Example, we know the internal, physically segregatable structure of ear in a lot detail, like, the basilar membrane, organ of corti, malleus, incus and stapes, and also we know how these structures transform air pressure variations into electrical impulses synapsed to the auditory nerve fibres. Similar insights are also understood for eyes. However, what happens when it comes to our understanding of brain? Surprisingly, the brain is composed of a lump tissues - gray and white matter, and segragating it further into distict physical units isn't as straight forward as other organs of human body.
